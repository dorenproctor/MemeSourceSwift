This app displays memes and allows you to look through them, vote on them, and comment.
The images and data are all stored on a Node.js server on an AWS EC2 server. The app makes http calls to interact with the server.

Note: I will try to make sure my server is up and running for the next week. If you have issues for whatever reason, please contact me.
